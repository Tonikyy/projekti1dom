# projekti1dom
I chose the todo -list as my project because im fairly new to programming and it seemed like a task that i could manage to complete.

The project had some criterias and by making the UI look fairly nice and getting all the functions to work,
I think I did well. 
I didn't use as much local storage as I wanted, but I have to admit I ran out of time. Though I tried to find nice ways to use it, just didn't get them done in time.

In my todo -list I made:

    -Input with a function that makes a new <li> to <ul>
    -A button with a nice icon to delete <li>
    -A function that overlines a <li> after clicking it using js and css
    -A task counter that uses local storage for saving the total number of inputs
    -Button that deletes the saved data from the local storage.
